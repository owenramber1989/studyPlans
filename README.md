# studyPlans

I try to be a professional developer in the field of DBMS internals. I will outline my study plans here without specific deadlines. I will complete these tasks flexibly.

---

WHY I made a plan

It's well known that to be an expert in something always takes effort. Especially something that's quite complex and challenging. For DBMS, quite so. I have a lot of things to learn and numerous projects to finish. However the tasks tangled up and I can't figure out what exactly I should learn at the very moment and I can't learn all of these materials in a concurrent way. So I outlined my plans here. I will finish these items in order and as fast as I can.

**some splendid materials like course 15-445 or 15-721 not included because I already learned them**

## Specific Goals

- Mastered skills for writing high efficient programs in C++, rust and go.
- Proficient in debugging
- Know how to write elaborate test cases
- Be familiar with all essential techniques in query optimizer
- Be familiar with the pros and cons of different strategies in DBMS
- Enabled to write authentic English papers and speak English fluently
- To have a profound view of DBMS based on a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of areas such as operating systems, compilers, computer networks, and more.
